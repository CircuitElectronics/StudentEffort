    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistors, or MOSFETs, are integral components in modern electronics, widely recognized for their efficiency and versatility. As voltage-controlled devices, MOSFETs differ significantly from traditional bipolar junction transistors (BJTs). They utilize an insulated gate structure, enabling extremely high input impedance and low power requirements, which makes them ideal for a variety of applications such as amplification, switching, and digital logic circuits.\n",
    "\n",
    "A MOSFET is a four-terminal device having source(S), gate (G), drain (D) and body (B) terminals. In general, The body of the MOSFET is in connection with the source terminal thus forming a three-terminal device such as a field-effect transistor.\n",

    "## MOSFETs types\n",
    "MOSFETs operate in two main configurations: Enhancement Mode and Depletion Mode, with N-channel and P-channel variations. N-channel MOSFETs are particularly popular due to their superior electron mobility, which translates to faster operation and higher efficiency. These transistors work by applying a voltage to the gate terminal, which modulates the conductivity of a channel between the drain and source terminals, allowing or blocking current flow. This principle enables MOSFETs to function as switches or amplifiers with remarkable precision and speed.\n",

    "### Depletion Mode:\n",
    "The Depletion type MOSFET or D-MOSFET is a type of MOSFET that has a channel constructed during the process of fabrication. In other words, it has a channel even when there is no voltage applied to it. Therefore, it can conduct current between source and drain when the gate-source voltage V­­GS = 0 volts. Due to this reason, it is also known as “Normally ON” MOSFET.\n",
    "\n",
    "Connecting the gate-source terminal in reverse bias will deplete the channel of the charge carrier thus the name depletion MOSFET. It reduces the width of the channel until it completely vanishes. At this point, the D-MOSFET stops conduction and this V­GS voltage is known as VTH threshold voltage.\n",
    "\n",
    "If Gate and source is connected in forward bias and the VGS is increased, more majority carriers will get induced in the channel and its width will increase. It will result in increasing the current flow between drain and source. This is why the D-MOSFET can work in both depletion and enhancement mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "The D-MOSFET can be ‘N-channel D-MOSFET’ or ‘P-channel D-MOSFET’ depending on the channel being used. The type of channel also affects its biasing as well as its speed and current capacities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### N-Channel D-MOSFET\n",
    "\n",
    "In N-channel D-MOSFET, the source and drains electrode is placed on small N-type layers. While the gate electrode is placed on top of an insulating metal oxide layer that electrically insulates it from the channel beneath it. The channel made for N-type material is fabricated on top of a P-type substrate.\n",
    "\n",
    "![N-Channel-Depletion-Type-MOSFET.webp](./images/N-Channel-Depletion-Type-MOSFET.webp)\n",
    "\n",
    "The channel as it is made of N-type material consists of electrons as charge carriers. The voltage at the gate produces an electric field that affects the flow of these charge carriers.\n",
    "\n",
    "![N-Channel-D-MOSFET-Reverse-Biased.webp](./images/N-Channel-D-MOSFET-Reverse-Biased.webp)\n",
    "\n",
    "When the gate is connected in reverse bias i.e. negative voltage VGS < 0 volt is applied, the holes from the P-substrate will attract towards the gate, depleting it of the electrons and reduce the channel size. At certain negative VGS the MOSFET will stop conduction as there will be no channel. This V­GS is threshold voltage Vth. N-channel MOSFET has –Vth.\n",
    "\n",
    "While increasing VGS ­will enhance (increase) its conductivity i.e. the drain current ID will increase with the drain-source voltage VDS. However, this works in the ohmic region. When the VDS reaches the pinch-off voltage Vp, the IDS become saturated IDSS and the current stops increasing. This mode is used for switching applications."

    "The P-channel D-MOSFET has the same construction as an N-channel except for the drain, source electrodes lie on P-type layers. and the channel is made of P-layer over an N-type substrate. The charge carriers used are holes. The holes have one disadvantage over electrons. They are quite heavier than electrons and therefore can cause it to lose some speed in operation.\n",

    "\n",
    "When a positive VGS is applied at its gate, the electric field will cause to attract the electrons from the N-type substrate that combines with the holes thus depleting the channel of charge carriers. It reduces the width of the channel and the amount of current. at a certain point, the VGS  completely eliminates the channel and stops the flow of current.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, P-channel D-MOSFET has a positive threshold voltage i.e. it switches off when positive VGS is applied and switches on when there is no VGS. Applying negative voltage will induce more holes into the channel causing it to increase or enhance its current conduction."

Enhancement-mode and depletion-mode MOSFETs operate on opposite principles of gate voltage to control conduction, providing flexibility in circuit design. Similarly, n-channel and p-channel MOSFETs cater to different current flow directions and voltage requirements, expanding their usability across diverse systems. Understanding these distinctions and their operational principles allows engineers to select the optimal MOSFET type for specific needs, enabling efficient and reliable electronic designs."
