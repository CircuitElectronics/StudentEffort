    "# What is a Tunnel Diode?\n",

    "The tunnel diode is also known as the \"Esaki Diode\". It was invented by \"Leo Esaki\" in 1957, and for this invention, he received Nobel in 1973. Leo Esaki observed that if a semiconductor diode is heavily doped with impurities, it will exhibit negative resistance. Negative resistance means the current across the tunnel diode decreases when the voltage increases.\n",
    "A tunnel diode is also known as Esaki diode which is named after Leo Esaki for his work on the tunneling effect. The operation of tunnel diode depends on the quantum mechanics principle known as “Tunneling”. In electronics, tunneling means a direct flow of electrons across the small depletion region from n-side conduction band into the p-side valence band.\n",
    "The circuit symbol of tunnel diode is shown in the below figure. In tunnel diode, the p-type semiconductor act as an anode and the n-type semiconductor act as a cathode."

    "# Doping in a Tunnel Diode\n",
    "Doping in diodes involves adding impurities to a semiconductor material, such as silicon or gallium arsenide, to create regions with excess electrons (n-type) or holes (p-type), forming a p-n junction. The level of doping controls the diode's electrical characteristics, including its forward and reverse current behavior. In tunnel diodes, doping is extremely high—about 1000 times greater than a normal diode—resulting in a very narrow depletion region. The depletion region is a region in a p-n junction diode where mobile charge carriers (free electrons and holes) are absent. Depletion region acts like a barrier that opposes the flow of electrons from the n-type semiconductor and holes from the p-type semiconductor."

    "# What is Tunneling?\n",
    "In tunnel diode, the valence band and conduction band energy levels in the n-type semiconductor are lower than the valence band and conduction band energy levels in the p-type semiconductor. Unlike the ordinary p-n junction diode, the difference in energy levels is very high in tunnel diode. Because of this high difference in energy levels, the conduction band of the n-type material overlaps with the valence band of the p-type material.\n",
    "Quantum mechanics says that the electrons will directly penetrate through the depletion layer or barrier if the depletion width is very small.\n",
    "The depletion layer of tunnel diode is very small. It is in nanometers. So the electrons can directly tunnel across the small depletion region from n-side conduction band into the p-side valence band."

    "Because of this overlapping, the conduction band electrons at n-side and valence band holes at p-side are nearly at the same energy level. So when the temperature increases, some electrons tunnel from the conduction band of n-region to the valence band of p-region. In a similar way, holes tunnel from the valence band of p-region to the conduction band of n-region.\n",
