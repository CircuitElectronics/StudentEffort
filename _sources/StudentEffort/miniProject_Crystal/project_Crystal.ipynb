    "**Crystal oscillators** are essential components widely used in **electronic circuits** and systems.\n",
    "\n",
    " They function as highly stable frequency sources, relying on the mechanical resonance of piezoelectric crystals, typically **quartz**. When an alternating voltage is applied to the crystal, it vibrates at a precise frequency determined by its size and shape. This inherent stability makes crystal oscillators critical in various applications, including clocks, radios, computers, and communication devices. Their ability to provide accurate timing and frequency control is crucial for ensuring the reliable operation of modern electronic systems.\n",

    "\n",
    "Generally, **crystal oscillators** are used in **microprocessors** and **microcontrollers** to provide **clock signals**.\n",

    "Accurate time reference is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Types of crystal oscillators\n",
    "\n",
    "In the topic of microcontrollers and circuits, we have two types of crystal oscillators.\n",
    "\n",
    "internal crystal oscillator and external crystal oscillator which\n",
    "In this section, we will fully examine these **two types** of oscillators.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Internal crystal oscillator\n",
    "- External crystal oscillator\n",
    "\n",
    "### Internal crystal oscillator\n",
    "This type of oscillator consists of a circuit that includes a **resistor** and a **capacitor**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **advantages** of internal crystal oscillators include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is easy to use because of its simplicity.\n",
    "- It has a precise design, so there is no need to worry about the selected frequency.\n",
    "- It does not require any external parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among the most important **disadvantages** of the internal oscillator, the following can be mentioned:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lack of precision and stability\n",
    "- The conditions of the capacitors and resistances of these oscillators change with the temperature change.\n",
    "\n",
    "### External crystal oscillator\n",
    "\n",
    "The meaning of the external crystal oscillator is that\n",
    "The **crystal part** is *located outside* the oscillator *structure*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **advantages** of the external crystal oscillator include **very high accuracy** and **stability** at a very low cost\n",
    "The rate of frequency error is very low.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the external oscillator does not have any special **disadvantages** due to the high quality of construction and fixing the problems of the previous versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Types of crystals in terms of frequency\n",
    "\n",
    "There are **2 types** of crystals in terms of frequency shape.\n",
    "**High frequency** and **low frequency**.\n",
    "\n",
    "High frequency crystals are usually cut into simple rectangular plates.\n",
    "\n",
    "But low-frequency crystals, which are mostly used in digital clocks,\n",
    "They are cut in the form of a diapason.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another type of these oscillators are timing **quartz crystals** which\n",
    "They are used for frequencies ranging from hundreds of kilohertz to hundreds of megahertz.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quartz crystal is used inside testing and measuring instruments.\n",
    "\n",
    "![title](picture/Figure_2.jpg)\n",
    "- Figure(2): Quartz crystal\n",
    "\n",
    "# Price range of crystal oscillators\n",
    "\n",
    "On average, more than **two billion** crystals are produced every year.\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of oscillator has a lot of variety in terms of the number of bases, how it works and the type of crystal used\n",
    "Due to this diversity, they also have different price ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "# How crystal oscillators work\n",
    "\n",
    "When we cut and mount a **quartz crystal** in the right shape,\n",
    "We can bend it by placing it in an electric field (applying a voltage to a nearby electrode or to the crystal).\n",
    "\n",
    "This feature is called **piezoelectricity**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In oscillators, when we interrupt or remove the electric field,\n",
    "As the quartz returns to its original shape, it generates an electric field and this causes a **voltage** to be generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "This quartz crystal behavior is similar to a circuit consisting of an **inductor**, **capacitor** and **resistor** (RLC circuit) with a precise resonant frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Difference between crystal and oscillator\n",
    "\n",
    "### reminder :\n",
    "-  (Clock Signal) : In electronics, and especially in synchronous logic circuits, the clock signal (in English: clock signal), clock pulse, or clock, is a signal that regularly oscillates between two states (High and Low), and is used to coordinate the operation of circuit parts. Digital is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "This definition is as follows: \"Each processor has a speed for processing, which is called a clock.\"\n",
    "The crystal needs several logic gates and stabilizing capacitors to generate the clock\n",
    "They are usually built into the microcontroller.\n",
    "For this reason, the crystal is connected to two pins of the microcontroller.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Tips to know when working with the oscillator\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important points in working with oscillators is to use only one crystal oscillator in designing circuits.\n",
    "Prevent the occurrence of electronic self-stability errors (Metastability In Electronics).\n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that the crystal is a cut **piece of quartz** stone and\n",
    "It has regular vibrations and is placed between two **spring-like** parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, it is more like a mechanical part than an electronic one, and that is why it is **very sensitive** to impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "### reminder :\n",
    "- Frequency Stability :\n",
    "One of the most important features of all oscillators is \"Frequency Stability\" or in other words, the ability of the oscillator to provide a stable output frequency with variable load conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some factors influencing the **frequency stability** of an oscillator in general include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Temperature changes\n",
    "- Load changes\n",
    "- Voltage changes in the DC power source\n",
    "\n",
    "By properly choosing the elements used in the resonant **feedback circuit** such as the **amplifier**, the *frequency stability* of the output signal can be improved. But in the tank circuit of **LC** and **RC** **oscillators**, there are limits for the achievable frequency stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Quartz crystal oscillator\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve high levels of **frequency stability**, it is necessary that **\"Quartz Crystal\"** undertakes the task of frequency detection. In this way, an oscillator circuit is created, which is generally called \"Quartz Crystal Oscillator\".\n",
    "\n",
    "When a voltage source is applied to a thin piece of quartz crystal, its shape changes. This property in the crystal is called **Piezo-Electric Effect**. Piezo-electric effect is a property of the crystal in which the **electric** charge creates a **mechanical** force by changing the shape of the crystal. Conversely, the mechanical force on the crystal can also produce an electric charge.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Piezo-electric parts** can be placed in the category of **transducers**. These parts convert one type of energy into another type of energy *(electrical to mechanical and mechanical to electrical)*. The piezoelectric effect causes mechanical vibrations or electrical oscillations that can be used instead of the *LC tank* circuit in oscillators.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different types of crystal materials that can be used as oscillators. One of the most famous types of these crystalline materials for electronic circuits is **quartz mineral** due to its high mechanical strength.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The quartz crystal** used in the **quartz crystal oscillator** is a very **small** and **narrow blade** of quartz that has parallel cuts on both sides and is connected to metal parts. to make the required electrical connections. The physical dimensions and thickness required for this piece of quartz crystal are controlled with special precision. Because this piece determines the final or fundamental frequency of oscillations. Fundamental frequency is also known as \"characteristic frequency\" in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Once the crystal piece is properly *cut* and *shaped*, it cannot be used at other frequencies. In other words, the **dimensions** and **shape** of the crystal determine the fundamental frequency of oscillations in the crystal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The crystal characteristic or characteristic frequency is inversely proportional to the physical thickness of the crystal between the two metal plates. A mechanically vibrating crystal can be represented by its equivalent electrical circuit. This electric circuit includes small resistance **R**, large inductance **L** and small capacitor **C**. The figure below shows the equivalent circuit of a quartz crystal:\n",
    "\n",
    "![title](picture/Figure_3.png)\n",
    "- Figure(3): Quartz Crystal Equivalent Model\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the shape of the equivalent electric circuit of the quartz crystal, including an RLC series circuit in parallel with the capacitor **cP** is RLC series circuit, representing mechanical vibrations of crystal and parallel capacitor Cp\n",
    "It represents the electrical connections of the crystal. Quartz crystal oscillators tend to oscillate at the resonant frequency of their series **RLC** circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The equivalent impedance of the crystal includes a series resonance. In this case, the capacitor Cs with inductance Ls \n",
    "It resonates at the operating frequency of the crystal. This frequency, called the frequency of the crystal series or fs\n",
    "is known As well as this series frequency, there is also a secondary frequency that occurs as a result of parallel resonance. This parallel resonance between series elements Ls and Cs and parallel capacitor Cp it happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "![title](picture/Figure_4.png)\n",
    "- Figure(4): Crystal Impedance against Frequency\n",
    "\n",
    "By increasing the frequency at the output of the oscillator, at a certain frequency the interaction between the capacitor and the series inductor Cs and Ls creates a series resonant circuit. This series resonant circuit minimizes the output impedance of the crystal. The output impedance of the crystal in this case with Rs equals This point is called the resonant frequency of the crystal series and with fs is shown. At frequencies lower than this frequency, the crystal becomes capacitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the oscillation frequency of the oscillator is greater than the series resonance point of the circuit, the crystal oscillator will reach the parallel resonance frequency point (Fp), will have a selfie feature. At this point of frequency, the interaction between the series inductor (Ls) and parallel capacitor Cp It creates a tuned LC tank circuit. For this reason, the impedance at both ends of the crystal reaches its maximum possible value.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be seen that the quartz crystal oscillator is a combination of series and parallel tuned resonant circuits. This oscillator produces oscillating signals at two different frequencies. Depending on how the crystal is cut, these two different frequencies may have a slight difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the crystal oscillator cannot be tuned for two frequencies at the same time, it is necessary to tune the crystal oscillator circuit for a specific frequency. Because the crystal shows its oscillatory property only in one of the series or parallel resonance frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, depending on the circuit specifications, a quartz crystal may operate as a capacitor, inductor, or series or parallel resonant circuit. To make this clear, we can plot the crystal reactance as a function of frequency. The following figure shows the reactance of the crystal in terms of frequency:\n",
    "\n",
    "![title](picture/Figure_5.png)\n",
    "- Figure(5): Crystal Reactance against Frequency\n",
    "\n",
    "Because at frequencies lower than fs and frequencies higher than fp The crystal is capacitive, so the series reactance at frequency fs Inversely with the capacitor Cs It is proportional. between frequencies fs and fp , the crystal shows the self-self property. Because two parallel capacitors cancel each other out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the series resonance frequency relation for the crystal (fs) is given as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}  \n",
    "fs = \\frac{1}{2π sqrt(Ls Cs)}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",

    "cp is equal. This frequency is given as follows:\n",

    "\\begin{equation}  \n",
    "fp = \\frac{1}{2π sqrt(Ls (\\frac{Cp Cs}{Cp + Cs}))}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",

    "$$Rs = 6.4 Ω , Cs = 0.09972pF , Ls = 2.546mH $$\n",
    "\n",
    "If the capacitor between the two terminals of this crystal (Cp) an equal amount 28.68 pF have, calculate the value of the fundamental frequency and the frequency of the secondary resonance of the crystal.\n",

    "Solution: Resonance frequency of crystal series or the same fp\n",

    "\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The parallel resonance frequency of the crystal or fp\n",
    "It is also calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}  \n",
    "fp = \\frac{1}{2π sqrt(Ls (\\frac{Cp Cs}{Cp + Cs}))}\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "$$fp = 10004996Hz ≈ 10.005 MHz$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be seen that the difference between the fundamental frequency of the crystal (fs) and (fp) Very small and approx 18kHz is.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$fp - fs = 10.005 MHz − 9.987 MHz = 18 kHz$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "However, in this frequency range, the **Quality Factor** of the crystal is a very large number. Because the inductance of the crystal is much larger than its capacitance or resistance values. For this example, the quality coefficient of the crystal oscillator at the series resonance frequency is given as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}  \n",
    "Q = \\frac{XL}{R} = \\frac{2π fL}{R} = \\frac{2π × 9.987 ×10^6 × 0.002546}{6.4}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Q = 24966 ≈ 25000$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The magnitude of the quality factor in this example (25000), due to the large ratio XL/R .\n",
    "The quality factor of most crystal oscillators is in the range of 20,000 to 200,000. But the quality coefficient of the tank circuit set in the best LC oscillators is much less than 1000. A large number of the crystal quality coefficient represents a better frequency stability of the crystal in its working frequency. Due to its better frequency stability, this mineral is widely used to make crystal oscillator circuits.\n",
    "\n",
    "We observed that the quartz crystal has the same resonant frequency as the tuned LC tank circuit. with the difference that its quality factor is much larger. Larger quality factor, due to series resistance (Rs) small crystal oscillator occurs. Consequently, quartz crystal is a good choice for use in high frequency oscillators.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Microprocessor clock with quartz crystal\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to end the topic of quartz crystal oscillators without mentioning crystal clock microprocessors. In general, all microprocessors, microcontrollers, PICs and CPUs use a quartz crystal oscillator in their frequency determination section to generate the desired clock waveform. Because we know that crystal oscillators provide the highest frequency accuracy and stability compared to resistance-capacitance (RC) and self-capacitance (LC) oscillators.\n",
    "\n",
    "CPU clock indicates how fast a processor can work and perform information processing operations with a microprocessor, PIC or microcontroller. clock speed 1MHz For these parts, it means that this processor can perform one million internal data processing operations per second in each clock cycle. Generally, all a microprocessor needs to generate a clock waveform is a crystal and two ceramic capacitors with values ​​between 15 and 33 picofarads.
