    "This application note describes several useful junction field effect transistor circuit configurations. The high input impedance and low-noise circuits are often used as input stages to voltage measurement instruments such as oscilloscopes and digital volt meters.\n",

    "The differential amplifier is a very widely used circuit in applications where the difference between two voltages is to be measured, such as the input stage of an operational amplifier. The use of JFETs in this application provides high input impedance and low input leakage current. Constant current sources have many uses such as setting bias conditions for many other circuits in a system, sourcing and/or sinking current for a sensor and replacing the source resistor in a differential amplifier circuit. Voltage controlled resistors are normally found in automatic gain control circuits and voltage controlled tuning circuits.\n",
