    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Current Source?\n",
    "A **current source** is a circuit that provides a constant current, regardless of changes in load resistance or voltage across it. It is a fundamental component in analog circuits for tasks like biasing, signal regulation, and voltage references.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two significant current sources include:\n",
    "1. **Widlar Current Source** (developed by Bob Widlar)\n",
    "2. **Wilson Current Mirror** (developed by George Wilson)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project\n",
    ", we will explain the concepts, circuit design, advantages, and detailed working principles of these two circuits.\n",

    "### Overview\n",
    "The **Widlar current source** is an improvement on the basic current source. It was designed by Bob Widlar in the 1960s to address limitations in op-amp biasing circuits. Widlar's design adds simplicity and efficiency for producing low output currents with higher precision and stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Features of Widlar Current Source\n",
    "1. **Emitter Degeneration**: Addition of resistor $R_2$ reduces the output current.\n",
    "2. **Output Resistance**: Higher than simple current sources, ranging from **10 kΩ to 100 kΩ**.\n",
    "3. **Small Output Currents**: Ideal for producing small currents, typically between **10 μA to 500 μA**.\n",
    "4. **Temperature Proportional Behavior**: Current output depends on absolute temperature (IPTAT).\n",
    "5. **$V_{BE}$ Compensation**: Helps compensate for transistor mismatches.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "The Widlar current source circuit adds resistor **$R_2$** at the emitter of Q2, which creates a voltage drop that limits the output current $I_{C2}$ below the reference current $I_{REF}$.\n",

    "### How the Widlar Current Source Works\n",
    "1. **Emitter Degeneration**:\n",
    "   - Resistor $R_2$ introduces a voltage drop across the emitter of Q2. This voltage drop reduces the collector current $I_{C2}$, which becomes smaller than $I_{REF}$.\n",
    "2. **Current Division**:\n",
    "   - The relationship between $I_{REF}$, $I_{C2}$, and $R_2$ is defined using the thermal voltage $V_T$:\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     I_{C2} = I_{REF} \\cdot \\exp\\left(-\\frac{V_{R2}}{V_T}\\right)\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     Where:\n",
    "     - $V_{R2}$ is the voltage drop across $R_2$, calculated as $I_{C2} \\cdot R_2$.\n",
    "     - $V_T \\approx 26 \\ \\text{mV}$ at room temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Output Resistance**:\n",
    "   - Adding $R_2$ increases the **output resistance** of the circuit, making it more stable compared to a basic current source. The output resistance typically ranges between **10 kΩ to 100 kΩ**.\n",
    "4. **Temperature Compensation**:\n",
    "   - Since the current depends on $V_T$ (which is temperature proportional), the circuit behaves proportionally with temperature (IPTAT).\n",
